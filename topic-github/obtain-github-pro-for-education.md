# Guide to obtain your Github Team upgrade 

Thanks to the GitHub Education program, all members of our team can benefit of the GitHub Team Subscription Plan for free.
All you need is to apply to the program at https://education.github.com.

Once validated, your account subscription will be automatically updated, which will give you access to more features of GitHub, such as Wiki, Pages, 3000 min CI/CD /month, and more (See https://github.com/pricing for more details).

Note that this will also give you access to [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for free (See [GitHub Copilot: How To](./github-copilot-getting-started.md)).

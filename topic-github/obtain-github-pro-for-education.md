You will be asked to provide a proof of your CHUV affiliation, such as a copy of your contract.

Once validated, your account subscription will be automatically updated, which will give you access to more features of GitHub, such as Wiki, Pages, 3000 min CI/CD /month, and more (See https://github.com/pricing for more details).

**Note:** This will also give you access to [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for free ðŸ˜Ž (See [Getting started with GitHub Copilot](./github-copilot-getting-started.md)).
